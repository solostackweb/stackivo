/**
 * Single source of truth for the project lifecycle.
 *
 * Adding a status requires three coordinated edits:
 *   1. The DB CHECK constraint (`supabase/migrations/00XX_*`)
 *   2. The `ProjectStatusRow` union in `@/lib/supabase/types`
 *   3. The entry below
 *
 * Every piece of UI (chips, dropdowns, kanban columns, the timeline)
 * reads from `PROJECT_STATUS_CONFIG` so they all stay in lock-step
 * automatically. The shape is intentionally dependency-free so server
 * code and client components can both import it.
