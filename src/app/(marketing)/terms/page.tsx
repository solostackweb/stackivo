      </p>

      <h3>Feature availability by plan</h3>
      <p>
        The features available to you depend on your active Plan. A summary of
        what each Plan includes is always available on the{" "}
        <Link href="/pricing">pricing page</Link> and in the{" "}
        <Link href="/docs">documentation</Link>. Key gating points:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Free plan</strong>: limited to 5 lifetime clients (deleting a
          client does not free up a slot). Contracts are visible in the dashboard
          but cannot be sent. The client portal and e-signatures are not
          available. Payment links via Razorpay are available at no cost from
          Stackivo (Razorpay&rsquo;s own fees apply).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Pro plan</strong>: unlimited clients and contracts, e-signature,
          contract templates, client portal, custom branding, recurring invoices,
          project file sharing, billable rate tracking, time report export, GST
          reports, and 5 GB storage.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Business plan</strong>: everything in Pro, plus team
          collaborators, API access, custom portal branding, priority support,
          and 50 GB storage.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We reserve the right to adjust Plan features and limits with reasonable
        notice. If we materially reduce a paid feature, we will notify you by
        email at least 30 days in advance.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Plans, billing, and payments</h2>

      <h3>Subscription and renewal</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Paid plans are billed in advance — monthly or annually — via Razorpay.
          All prices are in <strong>Indian Rupees (INR)</strong>. GST is applied
          where applicable.
        </li>
        <li>
          Subscriptions renew <strong>automatically</strong> at the end of each
          billing period unless you cancel before the renewal date.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cancellation takes effect at the end of the current paid period. You
          retain full access to your Plan features until then. After expiry, your
          account reverts to the Free plan.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Annual billing</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Annual plans are billed as a single upfront charge. You save the
          equivalent of two months compared to monthly billing.
        </li>
        <li>
          Switching from monthly to annual: unused days on your current monthly
          cycle are prorated as credit toward the annual charge.
        </li>
        <li>
          Annual subscriptions are non-refundable after the 30-day refund window
          (see below).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Price changes</h3>
      <p>
        We may change our prices. If we increase the price of your active paid
        Plan, we will notify you by email at least <strong>30 days</strong>{" "}
        before the new price applies to your renewal. If you do not cancel before
        the renewal, you accept the new price.
      </p>

      <h3>Refund policy</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          You may request a full refund within <strong>30 days</strong> of any
          subscription payment by emailing{" "}
          <a href="mailto:support@stackivo.me">support@stackivo.me</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          After 30 days, payments are non-refundable, except where required by
          applicable Indian consumer protection law.
        </li>
        <li>
          Refunds are processed to the original payment method via Razorpay and
          typically appear within 5–7 business days.
        </li>
        <li>
          We process refunds in good faith. Abuse of the refund policy (e.g.
          repeated refund requests) may result in account restriction.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Free plan limits</h3>
      <p>
        The Free plan is free indefinitely, subject to the client limit and
        feature restrictions described above. We reserve the right to retire,
        modify, or restrict the Free plan with 60 days&rsquo; notice.
      </p>

      <h2>5. AI features — Ask AI</h2>
      <p>
        Stackivo includes an AI assistant (&ldquo;Ask AI&rdquo;) that helps you
        create invoices, contracts, welcome documents, clients, and projects from
        natural-language descriptions. The AI is powered by{" "}
        <strong>Groq&rsquo;s API</strong>.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Review before sending</strong>: AI-generated drafts (invoices,
          contracts, welcome documents) are always saved as drafts and opened in
          the relevant editor. Nothing is sent to your clients automatically as a
          result of an AI workflow. You are responsible for reviewing and
          approving all AI-generated content before it is shared.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Accuracy</strong>: AI-generated content may contain errors,
          omissions, or inaccuracies. We do not warrant that AI outputs are
          correct, legally sufficient, or appropriate for your specific
          situation. You must review all AI-generated documents — especially
          contracts — before relying on them.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>No legal or financial advice</strong>: Ask AI is a drafting
          tool, not a lawyer or accountant. Nothing generated by Ask AI
          constitutes legal or financial advice. For contracts with significant
          commercial value, consult a qualified professional.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Data processing</strong>: your prompts are sent to
          Groq&rsquo;s infrastructure for inference. By using Ask AI, you
          consent to this transfer. We do not use your data to train AI models.
          See our <Link href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</Link> for details.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Availability</strong>: AI features depend on third-party API
          availability. We do not guarantee uptime or response quality from
          Groq&rsquo;s API.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>6. Your data — ownership and licence</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>You own your User Content.</strong> We make no claim to
          ownership of the clients, invoices, contracts, files, or any other
          data you create in Stackivo.
        </li>
        <li>
          By using the Service, you grant us a limited, non-exclusive,
          royalty-free licence to store, process, and transmit your User Content
          solely to provide and improve the Service. This licence ends when you
          delete your account.
        </li>
        <li>
          You represent that you have the right to upload and use any content
          you submit, and that it does not infringe any third party&rsquo;s
          rights.
        </li>
        <li>
          You can export all your data as JSON from{" "}
          <strong>Settings → Data &amp; export</strong> at any time.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Data after account deletion</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          On account deletion, your data is soft-deleted immediately and
          permanently deleted after a 30-day recovery window.
        </li>
        <li>
          GST-related invoice records are retained in anonymised form for 8
          years as required by Indian law.
        </li>
        <li>
          Your data is never deleted solely because you downgrade to the Free
          plan or cancel a paid subscription.
        </li>
      </ul>

      </ul>
      <p>
        We reserve the right to suspend or permanently terminate accounts that
        breach these rules, with or without prior notice, depending on the
        severity of the violation.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Intellectual property</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The Stackivo name, logo, product design, codebase, documentation, and
          all associated intellectual property are owned by Developer Bazaar
          Technologies and protected by Indian and international IP law.
        </li>
        <li>
          Your use of the Service does not grant you any rights in our

        Desk, Cloudflare R2, and Vercel. Your use of these integrations is also

        third-party providers, nor for any downtime or data loss caused by them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Payment processing is handled by Razorpay. By making or receiving
        payments through Stackivo, you agree to{" "}

      </p>

      <h2>10. Service availability and modifications</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          We aim for high availability but do not guarantee uninterrupted or
          error-free access. We may perform scheduled or emergency maintenance at
          any time.
        </li>
        <li>
          We may add, modify, or remove features of the Service at any time. For
          significant removals affecting paid features, we will provide at least
          30 days&rsquo; notice.
        </li>
        <li>
          In the event of an extended outage caused by Stackivo (not
          third-party providers), paid users may request a prorated credit for
          the affected period.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>11. Storage limits</h2>
      <p>
        File storage is subject to the limits of your Plan (100 MB on Free, 5
        GB on Pro, 50 GB on Business). If you exceed your storage limit, you
        will not be able to upload new files until you upgrade or free up space.
        We will notify you when you approach your limit.
      </p>

      <h2>12. Client relationships</h2>
      <p>
        Stackivo is a tool you use to manage your client relationships.{" "}
        <strong>
          We are not a party to any agreement between you and your clients.
        </strong>{" "}
        Contracts you create and send through Stackivo are legally between you
        and your client — Stackivo is only the delivery and signing platform.
        We are not responsible for:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Disputes between you and your clients.</li>
        <li>Non-payment by your clients.</li>
        <li>
          The legal enforceability of contracts created using Stackivo in any
          particular jurisdiction.
        </li>
        <li>
          Any errors in your invoices or contracts that you failed to review
          before sending.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The e-signature feature captures the signatory&rsquo;s IP address,
        timestamp, and signature. Stackivo does not provide any guarantee of
        the legal admissibility of electronic signatures under any specific
        law. For high-value or regulated contracts, consult a lawyer.
      </p>

      <h2>13. GST and tax compliance</h2>
      <p>
        Stackivo automates GST calculations (CGST, SGST, IGST) based on the
        addresses and GSTINs you provide. You are responsible for:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Entering accurate business address and GSTIN information so that the
          correct tax type is applied.
        </li>
        <li>Filing your GST returns (GSTR-1, GSTR-3B, etc.) correctly.</li>
        <li>
          Verifying the GST amounts on your invoices before sending them to
          clients.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Stackivo is a calculation and compliance aid, not a tax advisor. We are
        not responsible for errors arising from incorrect information you provide
        or from changes in tax regulations that have not yet been reflected in
        the Service.
      </p>

      <h2>14. Limitation of liability</h2>
      <p>
        To the maximum extent permitted by applicable Indian law:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Total liability cap</strong>: Stackivo&rsquo;s total
          cumulative liability arising out of or related to the Service is
          limited to the greater of (a) the amount you paid us in the{" "}
          <strong>12 months</strong> preceding the event giving rise to the
          claim, or (b) ₹5,000.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Exclusion of indirect damages</strong>: we are not liable for
          any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages,
          including loss of profits, loss of data, loss of goodwill, or business
          interruption — even if we have been advised of the possibility of such
          damages.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>AI outputs</strong>: we are not liable for any loss or damage
          arising from your reliance on AI-generated content (invoices,
          contracts, welcome documents) without adequate review.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Third-party services</strong>: we are not liable for any
          failure, outage, data loss, or security incident caused by
          third-party providers (Razorpay, Supabase, Groq, Cloudflare, etc.).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Client relationships</strong>: we are not liable for disputes,

          clients.

      </ul>
      <p>
        Nothing in these Terms limits liability that cannot be excluded under
        mandatory Indian consumer protection law.

      <p>
        You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Developer Bazaar
