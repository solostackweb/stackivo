      <h2>Why Stackivo exists</h2>
      <p>
        Indian freelancers stitch together five tools to run a one-person
        business: a US-built invoicing app that pretends GST doesn&rsquo;t
        exist, a separate contracts tool, a separate time tracker, a
        spreadsheet for revenue, and an inbox full of late-payment chases.
      </p>
      <p>
        We&rsquo;ve felt this pain ourselves. Stackivo exists to collapse all
        of it into one calm workspace — designed first for freelancers in
        India, with GST, place-of-supply, and INR pricing baked in from day
        zero.
      </p>

      <h2>What we believe</h2>

      <h3>India-first, not India-also</h3>
      <p>
        Most freelance SaaS treats India as an afterthought. We treat it as
        the home market: CGST/SGST/IGST split correctly, GSTIN validation,
        ₹ everywhere, and pricing that respects Indian purchasing power.
      </p>

      <h3>Free should be useful</h3>
      <p>
        Our free plan isn&rsquo;t a 14-day trial in disguise. You get every
        workflow — invoices, contracts, projects, time, Pulse — capped only
        at 5 lifetime clients. That&rsquo;s a real business for a real
        starting freelancer.
      </p>

      <h3>Your data is yours</h3>
      <p>
        Every workspace is isolated through Supabase row-level security
        policies — no other user can ever read your data. You can export
        everything as JSON at any time, and we&rsquo;ll never hold your
        records hostage if you cancel.
      </p>

      <h3>We build in the open</h3>
      <p>
        Our roadmap is public. The features that ship are the ones our
        users ask for. If something breaks, we&rsquo;d rather you tell us
        than churn quietly.
      </p>

      <h2>The team</h2>
      <p>
        Stackivo is a small team working from India. We answer support
        ourselves — there&rsquo;s no offshore tier-one queue between you
        and the people who built the product.
